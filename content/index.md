Hi, my name is **Alisha Gomes!** Welcome to my corner of the internet. I am a senior at the New Jersey Institute of Technology studying Information Systems, pursuing a career in technology. I am currently learning about all things cybersecurity, software engineering, and user experience design and research. You can find more about what I'm interested in by exploring this website. 

I recently came across the concept of a [[Digital Gardening]] and I couldn't resist making one for myself. I am passionate about the concept of learning in public, and believe that doing so can also benefit others. This website is meant to be a playground - some things might make sense, and some might not. But I'll do my best to make things fun and informative! 

On a more technical note, this website uses [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) made by [Jacky Zhao](https://jzhao.xyz/), as well as GitHub to host and Obsidian for creating content.

Please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alishagomes/) or [email](mailto:alishagomes88@gmail.com) to connect ♡!
