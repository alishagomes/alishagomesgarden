When first getting into cybersecurity, keeping up to date with the latest trends and news in cybersecurity wasn't all too important for me. After all, didn't I want to start with the basics? I had this ill-informed belief that one *had* to first be familiar with cybersecurity to read the news. While some articles are highly technical, I think dissecting an article (looking up things you don't understand) plays an integral role in learning about security. 

All in all, even beginners should learn the latest happenings in cyber, and these are my favorite resources for doing just that:

Websites (for the readers):
1. darkreading.com - my favorite resource for keeping up to date with everything cybersecurity. I think the website is very well organized and you can find articles across a wide range of areas including application security, mobile security, cyber risk, cloud security, data privacy, and more. It's very easy to find what you're looking for and the articles are accessible. 
2. thehackernews.com - very popular, easy-to-understand, and covers a wide range of topics. Some of the articles are behind a paywall, which is a little annoying.
3. bleepingcomputer.com - contains a mix of news, tutorials, and more. There are a lot of sponsored links and ads, which is distracting. I like how consumer-friendly it is and the tutorials are easy-to-follow.

Podcasts (for the listeners):
1. Microsoft Threat Intelligence Podcast - a new favorite as I'm getting more into threat intelligence. I think the host is incredible and it is informing, entertaining, and funny at the same time.
2. Darknet Diaries - this one is a classic and if you're a fan of true crime, definitely give this one a try! 
3. Security Now - Longer episodes but very informative and the hosts are a great time!
4. Hacked - Such a fun podcast! It's accessible and I think it gets a lot of people interested in cybersecurity.
5. CyberWire Daily - I love this podcast. Every episode is well-researched, relevant, and interesting. The episodes are also short and can be listened to during your commute.
6. Cybersecurity Simplified - I've listened to almost all of their episodes. It's great for beginners, short, and straight-to-the-point.

To be quite honest, my podcast lineup varies depending on what I'm currently interested in. Often I just look up a topic on spotify, search according to episodes, and listen. I've found some great gems by using this method.

Now I'm thinking I should start my own podcast.
