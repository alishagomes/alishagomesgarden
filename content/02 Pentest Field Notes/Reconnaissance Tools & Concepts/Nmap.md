#### Description
Used for host discovery, port scanning, enumerating services, detecting operating systems, etc. 

#### Types of Scans
- -sS TCP-SYN scan
	- send SYN packet
	- if SYN/ACK then port is open, RST then port is closed
	- send back RST packet 
- -sT TCP Connect scan
	- completes three-way handshake making it highly accurate but not the most stealthy
	- good for firewalls that only allows for outgoing packets
- -sU UDP scan
	- stateless protocol doesn't require three-way handshake making it slower and only returns response if the application is configured to do so
- -sA ACK scan
	- used to detect firewalls

#### Host Discovery
```
sudo nmap IP_Address -sn 
```

where -sn disables port scanning 

#### Other Helpful Options
- --packet-trace for showing all the packets that are send and received
- -n to disable DNS resolution
- --disable-arp-ping to disable ARP ping
- --reason displays reason for the port being a certain state
- saving results 
	- -oN normal output
	- -oG grepable output 
	- -oX XML output
- -p- scanning all ports
- -v verbose output 

#### Service Versions
- -sV

### NSE
- 14 categories of scripts
- -sC for default scripts 
- --script category for specific scripts 

#### Performance
- --min-parallelism number for the frequency the packets should have 
- -T 0-5 for how fast the scan shuld be 
- --max-rtt-timeout time 
- --min-rate number
- --max-retries number 


#### Firewalls and IDS/IPS Evasion

firewalls 
- use -sA method for filtering for firewalls 

IDS/IPS
- using decoys -D places random IP addresses into the IP header so the IDS/IPS does not know where the packet originated from 
- example: -D RND: 5
- specify the source IP address using -S option
- use --source-port 53 if you are in a demilitarized zone and the company's DNS servers are more trusted than the outside network
