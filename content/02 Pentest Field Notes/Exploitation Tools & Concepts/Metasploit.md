## Modules
- prepared scripts that can include auxiliary (provides assistance), encoders (ensuring payloads intact to destination), exploits, NOPs (keeping payloads consistent), plugins, post (gather information)

#### Syntax
```
<No.><type>/<os>/<service>/<name>
```

#### Key Commands
```
search
use 
options
info
set 
run
```

## Targets
- operating system identifiers 
- show targets command shows all vulnerable targets for specific exploit 

## Payloads
- returns a shell to attacker
- 3 types 
	- single: contains exploit and entire shellcode in one task, more stable 
	- stagers: work with stages; small and reliable
	- stages: payload components
- set payloads by doing show payloads

## Encoders
- makes payloads compatible with different computer architectures

## MSFVenom
- used to create payloads for exploits
- customizable
